            <h1>Project Outline</h1>
            <p>I will be building a remote playload delivery vehicle with a first person view camera. the idea of this vehicle is similar to a bomb disposal robot. Its strength is that it can be used to access areas that are not safe for humans. It will be capable of delivering a large payload and of transversing complex terrain</p>
