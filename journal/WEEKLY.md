I managed to find some spare time during the class to laser cut a prototyping plate for my project, however it was a little too thick. however I am not sure if I will be able to make them any thinner due to flex. Next period, I will test how much the plate (made of acrylic) will affect the center of gravity of the vehicle

I tested the the acrylic plate on my remote control car, and once I made it fit (Kind of) It stayed on the car through some low speed testing maneuvers without much increase in body roll. When a weight was placed on the car, the body roll was amplified substantially, but the car remained planed -the suspension did its job.
