# Systems Weekly Journal 2023

## 23rd February  
I managed to find some spare time during the class to laser cut a prototyping plate for my project, however it was a little too thick. however I am not sure if I will be able to make them any thinner due to flex. Next period, I will test how much the plate (made of acrylic) will affect the center of gravity of the vehicle

## 24th February
I tested the the acrylic plate on my remote control car, and once I made it fit (Kind of) It stayed on the car through some low speed testing maneuvers without much increase in body roll. When a weight was placed on the car, the body roll was amplified substantially, but the car remained planed -the suspension did its job.

#### Between here and my next entries not alot of work was completed due to us learning about other concepts including AC power and transistors
#### On the 26th of March I started writing my folio in this repository instead of Simplenote as it turned out not to be well suited formatting wise

## 1st of April through till 17th April
Whilst I have been on holiday in WA I have been doing bits of work here and there to catch up and hopefully get ahead a bit.

Whilst on the plane, I prototyped my initial clamping system design in more of a prototyping sort of way, allowing me to sleep on my idea for a couple of nights and then come up with my current design a little while later. I then started working on figuring out which navigation computer I was going to use, and eventually found a kit that will talk to my systems teacher about purchasing (not with my systems budget however...). After this, I began designing a rough drawing of the baseplate, which I will improve upon once I get home. I will also plot out where the standoffs will screw in and stress test the whole thing so that it can withstand rough driving.

## 3rd of May 
At the start of this week I ordered the navigation computers. They will arrive by the 22nd of May, apparently.

I started prototyping the navigation platform, via means of cardboard cutouts, allowing me to get the dimensions perfect and deal with any obstructions that I would have run into without, like the 2.4ghz antenna and the rear shocks.

I also 3d printed my clamping arms meaning I can construct my clamp prototype after I finish building the navigation platform. I am prioritising the navigation platform so that I when the computer arrives I am ready to install it, And I'll use the time inbetween to work on the clamping system. I also need to finish the navigation system first so that I can decide where and how the payload system will be mounted. 

## 10th of May
In this session I started redesigning my body mounts to account for the fact that I did not have long enough standoffs. This is not an ideal solution, but it will have to make do. I does have the side effect of allowing me to mount ports underneath the navigation platform, which is helpful.

I laser cut two of these mounts without checking if the other side would fit, and suprise! it did not. I did not have enough time to finish these clips, so they would have to wait until next session.

## 17th of May

I finished prototyping and building the navigation platform mounts, which is great because I was able to finally put the mounting holes in the navigation platform. I will be able to laser cut the navigation platform next week (or later this week if I'm lucky...) and I will be ready for the computers to arrive, which is very exciting! According to AusPost, they should arrive tomorrrow or the day after, which will mean that if I have the time I could probably get them fully operational by next week.
